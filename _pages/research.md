My research program is organized around four interconnected axes designed for **international collaboration** and **funding-aligned impact**.

## AXIS 1 — Collective Intelligence & Organizational AI
**Strategic focus:** formal models of coordination, multi-level knowledge, and collective adaptability in distributed intelligent systems.  
**Collaboration opportunities:** MAS theory groups, collective decision-making, computational social systems.  
**Funding alignment:** foundational AI, distributed coordination, trustworthy AI.

## AXIS 2 — LLM-Augmented Distributed Architectures
**Strategic focus:** LLMs as cognitive and coordination layers for multi-agent and cyber-physical systems.  
**Collaboration opportunities:** LLM labs, hybrid symbolic–neural AI, distributed AI.  
**Funding alignment:** frontier AI, hybrid AI systems, trustworthy/robust AI.

## AXIS 3 — AI-Driven Digital Twins for Adaptive Production
**Strategic focus:** Digital Twin ecosystems as environments for collective reasoning and resilient decision loops in Industry 4.0/5.0.  
**Collaboration opportunities:** smart manufacturing labs, cyber-physical systems, industrial AI.  
**Funding alignment:** Industry 4.0/5.0, sustainable manufacturing, digital transformation.

## AXIS 4 — Translational AI Systems (Industry & Health-Tech)
**Strategic focus:** deployment of distributed AI architectures in high-impact applied domains, from prototyping to TRL-oriented validation.  
**Collaboration opportunities:** applied AI networks, biomedical/wearables groups, innovation ecosystems.  
**Funding alignment:** applied AI, technology transfer, translational R&D.
